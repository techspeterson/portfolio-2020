# Tessa Peterson - Portfolio (Frontend)

A (very in-progress!) redesign of my personal portfolio. Built in React using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
- An OS-like interface with desktop icons, functional clock and battery icons, and more to come
- Clicking desktop icons will open the relevant "windows", which can be switched between or exited out of much like a regular browser window
- Desktop wallpaper is randomly generated using the Unsplash API (requires the backend server! but a default image is provided) and the app's colour scheme is derived from this image
- Embedded Twitter feed, email contact form
- Not much actual content............ yet

## How to run

Running `yarn start` in the project directory will start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## What's next?
- Actual up-to-date "about me" and "projects" sections! Like you'd expect from a real portfolio!
- More small interactive features!
- Nicer computer monitor CSS!
- Whatever else I feel like adding!
